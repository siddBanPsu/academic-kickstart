Hello everyone. Welcome to my small little webspace. 
Currently, I am based in warm and awesome Singapore and working for Traveloka as a NLP Senior Data Scientist. 
In mid 2019, I made a move (along with my wife) to Singapore from USA. 
I spent around 7 enjoyable years in USA before the move (first, in Pennsylvania followed by Silicon Valley, California). 
Other than work, I love to travel, sketch, hike and explore new dishes.
